/**
 * Queued password-reset email (audit 2026-07-20, L3-R1).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS — it is a SECURITY fix, not a reliability nicety. Payload's native
 * forgot-password sends inline and unguarded:
 *
 *   unknown address -> `if (!user) return null`   — returns EARLY, no send is attempted  => 200
 *   real account    -> `await email.sendEmail(...)` — unguarded                          => THROWS
 *                                                     on SMTP failure                    => non-2xx
 *
 * So during any SMTP outage the HTTP status discriminated registered addresses perfectly, on an
 * unauthenticated endpoint — an account-existence oracle visible to a direct API caller, with or
 * without our UI. Moving delivery OFF the request path means the endpoint can answer identically
 * for both branches (see `endpoints/forgotPassword.ts`), AND — because the job retries — the
 * "a reset link is on its way" message becomes TRUE rather than merely uniform.
 *
 * THE INPUT IS A USER ID, NEVER THE TOKEN. Successful jobs are removed (Payload's
 * `deleteJobOnComplete` defaults to true and we do not override it — verified empirically: the row
 * exists immediately after enqueue and is gone once autoRun processes it). But a job that EXHAUSTS
 * its retries is retained for diagnosis — and that is exactly the SMTP-outage case this task exists
 * to survive. A token in the input would therefore persist a live password-reset credential in
 * `payload_jobs` precisely when delivery was failing. The handler instead reads the CURRENT
 * `resetPasswordToken` off the user row at send time — the one place that token already lives by
 * design — so no second copy is created under any outcome.
 *
 * Precisely: consuming a reset does NOT erase the stored token. Installed `resetPassword.js` sets
 * `resetPasswordExpiration = now` (line 63) and leaves `resetPasswordToken` in place, so the value
 * persists but is dead. That is why the handler below checks the EXPIRATION rather than trusting the
 * token's presence — a used token is still readable, and emailing it again would send a dead link.
 *
 * A consequence worth knowing: if a second reset is requested before this job runs, the token has
 * rotated and this job sends the NEWEST link. That is correct — the newest link is the one that
 * works — and both emails then carry the same valid token.
