## SHIPPED + DEPLOYED + VERIFIED 2026-06-25 (Stage 2b finish + Stage 3 retire `lesson-bundles`)

Cutover complete. Code `d1bb614`; Rock-generated types + drop migration `1959daf`. Rock-verified
2026-06-25: roundtrip-regression 3/3 byte-identical, `verify-rbac` 7/7, `verify-stage2b-edit` 13/13,
`verify-stage2b-preview` 7/7, `verify-stage2-export` DOCX+PDF; app healthy on the new schema. The
collection-drop migration needed two hand-edits before applying — see DECISIONS 2026-06-25.

- **Stage 2b finish — admin Preview/Export on versions.** New version preview endpoints
  (`endpoints/previewVersion.ts`, GET saved + POST unsaved; shared shell/body-parse in
  `previewShared.ts`); the `PreviewBundle`/`ExportBundle` admin controls now drive the
  `lesson-bundle-versions` endpoints (a version has no published gate). Verifier:
  `verify-stage2b-preview.ts`.
- **Stage 3 — legacy `lesson-bundles` retired.** Deleted the collection and its entire bundle-path
  (`exportBundle`/`exportStatus`/`previewBundle` endpoints, `generateForBundle`, `generateArtifact`
  job, `bundleIntegrity`/`generatable` hooks, the five `lessonBundle*` access fns, `findReadableBundle`,
  `bundleScope`, and the obsolete bundle scripts). Shared content fields extracted to
  `fields/lessonContent.ts`; web upload re-homed to `lesson-plans` (`POST /api/lesson-plans/upload`);
  the generator/adapter/preview chain retyped from the vanishing `LessonBundle` to `LessonBundleVersion`
  (deleting the Stage-2a `as unknown as LessonBundle` casts). `verify-rbac.ts` slimmed to the
  People/Curriculum RBAC it uniquely covers (lesson-content RBAC lives in `verify-stage2b-edit`).
  Deployed: `generate:types` (dropped the `LessonBundle` type + `generateArtifact` task slug) +
  the `20260625_125532_drop_lesson_bundles` migration (applied 2026-06-25; 0 bundle tables remain,
  `lesson_plans`/`lesson_bundle_versions` intact).

## SHIPPED + DEPLOYED + VERIFIED 2026-06-24 (Official-version cutover: Stages 1, 2a, 2b-admin)

The Official-version model went from "schema only" to powering the live teacher + admin paths. All
deployed to the Rock and verified. See DECISIONS 2026-06-24 for reasoning.

- **Stage 1 — corpus backfill (`503b09f`).** Migrated the 13 legacy published bundles (ids 63–75) into
  13 `lesson-plans` + Official `lesson-bundle-versions` 1.0.0. Verified LOSSLESS: 39/39 documents
  regenerate byte-identically to their source bundles (`verify-migration.ts`). Legacy left untouched.
- **Stage 2a — teacher read/view/export on versions (`f857fb9`…`97b9379`).** Browse lists plans via
  their Official version; detail uses the plan id with a `?version=` selector (Official by default);
  content-preview + DOCX/PDF download run off the selected version. Generator-agnostic artifact cache
  (opaque `scope` key), `generateForVersion` (no published gate), `generateVersionArtifact` job,
  version export endpoints (GET serve / POST prepare / status). `roundtrip-regression` repointed to the
  version model (it had broken when ingest moved off bundles). Verified: roundtrip 3/3 byte-identical,
  reads 13/13, export DOCX+PDF.
- **Stage 2b — editing on versions (`d18a544`…`36e9500`).** Working-copy model: Official versions are
  immutable (`enforceVersionImmutable`) and undeletable (`enforceOfficialNotDeletable`); **Edit**
  (Editors + admins) forks a Not-Official working copy (`POST /:id/fork`) and opens its admin editor;
  **Make Official** (admins only, `POST /:id/make-official`) moves the plan pointer with no content
  copy. **Editors prose-edit** the working copy — the field-split was factored out of
  `enforceBundleStructure` into a shared `applyEditorFieldSplit` (bundle behavior unchanged) and
  applied to versions; `lessonBundleVersionUpdate` editor-scoped, `…Create` admin-only. Verified:
  `verify-stage2b-edit` 13/13 (immutability, fork, mutable copy, make-official, editor prose
  applies / structure+admin preserved, delete guard, editor+teacher denials), `verify-rbac` 36/36.
- **Remaining (at the time of this entry):** cut admin Preview/Export components to versions; **Stage 3**
  retire `lesson-bundles`. *(Both now CODE COMPLETE — see the newer entry at the top.)*

## SHIPPED + DEPLOYED 2026-06-24 (Audit #3 — export GET/POST split, Rock-verified)

- **Closed audit #3** (`9c9a701`): the export endpoint that enqueued heavy work on a cold GET was
  split — `GET /:id/export` is now serve-only (warm → 200 zip, cold → 409, never enqueues), and a new
  `POST /:id/export` is the only state-changing op (enqueue + rate limit). With the Payload auth
  cookie `SameSite=Lax` (confirmed in installed source), a cross-site POST has no cookie → 401, so the
  CSRF/enqueue vector is closed and GET is idempotent. `exportClient.ts` now POSTs to prepare then GETs
  to download.
- **Verified end-to-end on the Rock:** cold POST → 202 → poll ready → GET 200 zip; cold GET → 409;
  unauth POST → 401; Teacher POST `/api/payload-jobs` → 403. (Unauth `…/payload-jobs/run` → 404, not
  401/403 — noted in DECISIONS.)

## SHIPPED + DEPLOYED 2026-06-24 (Official-version model slice + schema migration)

- **Official-version product model chosen and first implementation slice shipped.** User clarified:
  upload/import creates `1.0.0 Official`; every edit creates a retained Not Official version; one
  global Official pointer per lesson plan; teachers can view/export all versions; Site Admins and
  matching Subject Admins can move the pointer without copying/restoring content. `SPEC.md` and
  `docs/DECISIONS.md` updated accordingly.
- **New Payload collections added** (`273816c`): `lesson-plans` owns stable identity +
  `officialVersion`; `lesson-bundle-versions` owns immutable structured snapshots. New access helpers
  gate version creation and Official pointer changes; hooks enforce generatable saved versions and
  reject an Official pointer to a version from another plan/subject-grade.
- **Upload/import write path moved to the new model** (`273816c`): valid uploads now create
  `LessonPlan` + `LessonBundleVersion 1.0.0`, then set `LessonPlan.officialVersion` to that exact
  snapshot. UI/CLI copy now says upload/import and Official/Not Official rather than ingest/draft/publish.
- **Editor convenience patch included** (`273816c`): frontend lesson detail shows an Edit button for
  users with edit scope; the browse page includes in-scope draft rows for admin-panel users; disallowed
  Manage collections are hidden from roles that cannot use them.
- **Schema migration follow-up** (`5c847e2`): initial deploy missed generated Payload types +
  migration, causing Rock admin errors such as `relation "lesson_plans" does not exist`. Generated on
  the Rock with Node 22, committed `payload-types.ts`, migration
  `20260624_221905_official_version_model`, and `migrations/index.ts`; redeployed successfully. Recent
  app logs no longer show missing-table errors.
- **Transition state at the time of this slice (since superseded — see the top entry):** legacy
  `lesson-bundles` still powered most browse/view/export/edit UI, and the 13 legacy bundles weren't yet
  copied into the new collections. All of that next work — version selector, export-by-version,
  edit-from-version, Make Official, and the corpus copy — shipped in Stages 1/2a/2b (top entry).

## SHIPPED 2026-06-24 (UX batch: one login, consistent menu, resources checkbox, admin polish)

Pushed to `main` (`783f019`…`bc9b656`); **not yet runtime-verified on the Rock** (the auth redirect,
admin header injection, one-logout, and font scale are admin-shell changes that can't be tested
locally). Details + reasoning in DECISIONS 2026-06-24.

- **One login form** (`b6eb0bc`): `/admin/login` → the frontend `/login` via a `next.config` redirect
  (replaced a 404-ing Payload view-override and an over-built middleware attempt). Everyone lands on
  `/` after sign-in; admins use the header "Admin" link. Brand `…Repository 3` → `…Repository`; admin
  login Logo graphic dropped; logged-out header hidden so `/login` is a clean splash.
- **Consistent top-right user menu** on both surfaces (`fbd637a`, `21769d1`): username · [Admin|Lessons]
  · logout · initials avatar. Admin side via `admin.components.header`; **one logout everywhere**
  (Payload's nav logout hidden); shared `Avatar` + `LogoutButton`. Dashboard "Browse lesson library"
  removed (header "Lessons" covers it).
- **"Include ARES Resources" checkbox** (`657bd3e`, `bc9b656`) replaces Standard/Compact on the teacher
  view + admin export + admin preview — one checkbox, unchecked by default, drives the view and all
  downloads; 4 teacher download buttons → DOCX/PDF. Mapping centralized in `lib/format.ts`; shared
  `ResourcesCheckbox`.
- **Admin polish** (`2ed3667`, `618f536`): fixed an admin-font regression (the `--base-body-size` bump
  was a spacing *divisor* and shrank things) by scaling the rem root/body to 15px; replaced the
  clipped "LPR3" nav wordmark with an 18×18 SVG document glyph (sized to Payload's `.step-nav__home`).
- **e2e login helper** updated for the single login (`4a19742`).

## SHIPPED 2026-06-23 (UI/admin redesign: strand-first Lesson Plans page + custom admin dashboard)

- **Strand-first Lesson Plans page** (`34b6122`, `7717088`; deployed + verified on the Rock). Replaced
  the arbitrary blue/grey title list with a server-rendered, strand-first browse shared by all roles:
  subject-grade → strand → sub-strand in **curriculum order** (`meta.substrand_id`, dotted-NUMERIC so
  `1.4 < 1.10`), four-step type scale (22/18/16/14), ink titles (accent only on hover), lesson counts,
  and a modest server-side `?q=` search. Labels use `meta.substrand_name` (drops the shouty stored
  `BIOLOGY GRADE 10: …` title); strand headings strip the stored `Strand N.M:` prefix → `Strand N:
  Name`. Pure logic in `src/lib/substrand.ts` with a DB-free unit suite (`tests/unit` + its own
  `vitest.unit.config.mts` + a `test:unit` script; `test`/`test:int` untouched). No schema/endpoint
  change.
- **Custom admin dashboard** (`7a2397b`, importMap `9e1e8cf`; deployed + verified). Replaced Payload's
  default collection-card dashboard (which duplicated the nav) with a quiet, role-aware landing
  (`src/components/AdminDashboard` via `admin.components.views.dashboard`; scoped styles in
  `(payload)/custom.scss`, theme-aware): title + factual role/scope line + additive-only actions
  (Site-Admin-only ingest hidden otherwise). NOT the modular widget system (its only built-in widget
  is the same collection cards). Registering a view needs an importMap regen (Node 22) — reproduced
  the generator's `default_<md5(path)>` entry locally so origin stayed correct without a Rock push.
- **Admin polish:** dropped the redundant Lesson-Bundles "META > Title Doc" list column
  (`disableListColumn`, `676333c`); renamed/reordered nav groups Content/Taxonomy/Collections →
  **Lesson plans / Curriculum / People** (`9d4d882`) — a truly headingless nav isn't a Payload config
  option (`admin.group:false` hides items), so renaming is the clean native fix. **Pending final Rock
  redeploy** for the last two (dashboard already live).

## SHIPPED + DEPLOYED + VERIFIED 2026-06-23 (async export: Jobs Queue + artifact cache + rate limit)

- **Phase 5 — readiness #1 closed (the "heavy generation is synchronous + unthrottled" top risk),
  and the deferred async half of the PDF slice finished. DEPLOYED + VERIFIED LIVE on the Rock**
  (merged to `main` as `aff318a`; feature `191510f`, Rock types+migration `17614f7`, Dockerfile fix
  `d3525c0`). Three composing protections:
  - **Artifact cache behind a seam** (`src/generator/artifactCache.ts`, `exportArtifacts.ts`):
    content-stable bytes cached by `(bundle, lockVersion, format, kind, doc)` — `lockVersion` is the
    cache-buster. Bounded on-disk LRU, durable via a `lesson3_artifact_cache` named volume. Warm
    `?as=pdf` skips Gotenberg entirely.
  - **Per-user rate limit** (`src/lib/rateLimit.ts`) on export + both preview verbs → `429 +
    Retry-After` (Payload 3 has no built-in `rateLimit`; verified against installed source).
  - **Jobs Queue async export** (`src/jobs/generateArtifact.ts` + `jobs` config): the `payload-jobs`
    collection (one migration). In-process `autoRun` with `limit` as the global concurrency cap on
    heavy conversions. Export is two-phase — warm → `200` zip; cold → enqueue + `202` + a status URL
    (`GET …/export/status?jobId=`). Frontend (`components/exportClient.ts`, admin button, teacher
    `DownloadButtons`) follows the 202 → poll → download handshake.
  - **Verified live:** cold export `202` → `autoRun` produced + cached → status `ready` → warm
    `200 application/zip` with a valid PDF (bundle 63).
- **Two Rock deployment traps found, fixed, recorded** (see DECISIONS 2026-06-23): a fresh Docker
  named volume mounts **root-owned** (app runs as `nextjs` uid 1001 → `EACCES`, export stuck at
  `202`) → Dockerfile now pre-creates + `chown`s the cache dir; and **`ARTIFACT_CACHE_DIR` must be in
  `.env`** (+ recreate the container) or the cache falls back to the non-writable `/app/.artifact-cache`.
- **Still open:** the formal PDF **fidelity gate** (`scripts/pdf-fidelity-check.ts`) — conversion is
  proven, the layout-faithfulness measurement still needs Rock-side ImageMagick + 3 Word oracle PDFs.
- **Post-merge `/simplify` cleanup** (tsc/eslint clean; behavior-preserving): shared
  `authorizeExportRequest` gate (`endpoints/exportAuth.ts`) across export + status; removed the
  now-redundant `TypedJobs` casts (types regenerated); restored **concurrent** PDF conversion in
  `produceArtifacts` (a serial-loop regression); de-duplicated `safePrefix` + the rate-limit `Bucket`
  type. Not yet runtime-verified on the Rock — re-run the export smoke-test on the next deploy.
- **External audit (GPT-5.5, 2026-06-23) + fixes** (tsc/eslint clean; **not yet runtime-verified**):
  - **Jobs surface locked down** (`5b58b41`): Payload's job defaults were open (run endpoint
    `() => true`; `payload-jobs` collection any-auth-user) → `jobs.access` + `jobsCollectionOverrides`
    restrict to Site Admins / system path. **High finding.**
  - **Async-export correctness** (`8bede30`): per-write-unique cache temp file (concurrent-write race),
    `isExportReady` now verifies every artifact not just the manifest, and the status poll returns
    `409 retry` on stale `lockVersion`/expired artifacts instead of spinning at "preparing".
  - **Deferred:** audit #3 (GET `/export` enqueues → move to POST) — held to pair with Rock runtime
    verification. Remaining audit items (#2/#7–#12) are the hardening backlog (NEXT-SESSION).

## SHIPPED + DEPLOYED + VERIFIED 2026-06-22 (§5 smoke-test PASSED + PDF export slice live)

- **§5 editor refinements browser smoke-test — ALL PASS on the Rock** (driven via Chrome MCP
  over Tailscale, real Teacher + Editor logins). Results: Teacher login redirects `/admin`→The App
  home; teacher format toggle Compact↔Standard re-renders server-side; **Teacher POST `/:id/preview`
  → 404** (edit-gated) while **GET → 200** (read-gated; the verb split holds); **Editor unsaved
  prose edit → Preview renders it** (banner "UNSAVED EDITS", nothing saved — stored bundle verified
  pristine afterwards); **Editor structural change (6→5 lessons) → 422**; oversize (>4 MB) → 413;
  array row labels via the shared `RowLabel` confirmed on all nested arrays (**Lesson N —**,
  **Phase N —**, **Section N —**, **Rubric row N —**). Closed the last open §5 item.
- **PDF export slice (§9) — DEPLOYED + VERIFIED LIVE on the Rock (commit `9ef5ccc`; cleanups
  `916341e`; hardening `293fea1`).** PDF = the generated DOCX run through a **local office engine**
  (one source of layout truth) via a swappable `docxToPdf(buffer)` seam → a **Gotenberg sidecar**
  (`gotenberg/gotenberg:8`, internal-only, no exposed port). `?as=pdf` on the export endpoint reuses
  the exact READ gate (`findReadableBundle` + `generateForBundle`) then converts each DOCX (502 if
  the converter is down; 120s `AbortSignal.timeout`); DOCX/PDF picker on the admin Export button +
  teacher download links. New files: `src/generator/docxToPdf.ts`, `scripts/pdf-fidelity-check.ts`;
  `GOTENBERG_URL` + `GOTENBERG_TIMEOUT_MS` in `.env.example`. **Verified live:** `gotenberg /health`
  → 200; authenticated Teacher `?as=pdf` of bundle 66 → 200 `application/zip` with 3 valid `%PDF`.
  No schema change → no migration. Jobs Queue deferred (synchronous-first, approved fallback).
- **`/simplify` cleanups (`916341e`):** moved `parseExportKind` into `parseFormat.ts` beside
  `parseLessonSequenceFormat`; parallelized the up-to-3 conversions with `Promise.all`; hoisted
  `gotenbergUrl()`. **Codex 2026-06-22 review:** PDF-specific findings fixed (Gotenberg timeout +
  teacher-render logging, `293fea1`); the rest triaged into the readiness backlog (see NEXT-SESSION).
- **Cosmetic follow-up:** lesson rows read "Lesson 1 — Lesson 1 — …" — `RowLabel` prepends
  `Lesson N —` but the stored `title` already begins with its own; Phase/Section/Rubric don't double.

## SHIPPED + DEPLOYED 2026-06-22 (UNIT model + contract hard gate + clean re-ingest)

- **Interim UNIT model fix DONE — the Sub-Strand Overview now renders end-to-end.** Modelled the
  17 canonical UNIT fields (was a dead `overview` stub), migration `add_unit_fields` applied on the
  Rock. `roundtrip-regression` **3/3** through the full DB path — LessonSequence **381 → 408 blocks**
  (the +27 overview rows). See DECISIONS (2026-06-22).
- **Contract drift promoted to a HARD GATE.** `ingestItems` pre-flight now throws on any drift.
  13/14 conform; **chem_1_4 is rejected** until its string `LESSONS[].number` → integer (deferred
  from the corpus). Once Mark fixes it: re-pull `upstream`, stage, ingest (gate admits it) → 14th.
- **Corpus re-ingested clean (13 fresh, ids 63–75, published 1.0.1).** Wiped the old empty-UNIT
  bundles (`scripts/wipe-bundles.ts`, new) and re-ingested the 13 conforming upstream files; all
  carry populated UNIT in the DB. Fidelity oracle refreshed to the populated-UNIT bio_1_4 + ARES's
  regenerated DOCX (Rock `out/ares-demo`, Desktop pending if wanted).
- **Teacher /admin UX fixed.** A Teacher who authenticates at `/admin` (stale cookie / admin login)
  was shown Payload's hard "no admin access" error. Now overridden via Payload's own
  `admin.components.views.unauthorized` → a server component `redirect('/')` to The App home.
  Verified on the Rock (Teacher→`/`, Editor→Dashboard). `importMap.js` regenerated canonically via
  `generate:importmap` (Rock, Node 22). See DECISIONS (2026-06-22).
- **On origin `c7b0589`; Rock mirrors origin, app rebuilt + up.** Types/migration/importMap were
  generated on the Rock (Node 22) then pulled to origin so **origin is the single source of truth**.
  `verify-rbac` 36/36; `roundtrip-regression` 3/3; hard gate proven to reject chem_1_4 live.
- **Rock staging dirs:** `out/ares-demo` (refreshed fidelity oracle — keep, used by
  `roundtrip-regression`), `out/ares-data` (the 13 staged corpus files — keep for re-ingest).
  Pre-existing untracked strays `11.17.0` (empty file) + `ingest-data/` (old bio_1_4) left as-is.

## 2026-06-18 (ARES contract — essentially converged)

- **Outcome: 13/14 ARES files now conform to our contract** (`upstream/main` @ `f36d47c`). Over a
  same-day back-and-forth Mark conformed the whole pipeline to `ares-contract v1.0.0` AND made the
  generator **schema-validate its own tool-use output + retry on off-schema** (the P1 validate-on-emit
  ask, built in). Drift trend 55→43→18→**8**. All earlier issues resolved upstream (bio_1_4 parse
  regression, `safetyNotes` corruption, stray `UNIT.keyInquiry`, missing `META`/`UNIT.content`,
  bio_3_1 gap). **We adopted ARES's canonical `storylineThread`** to match their SCHEMA.md (commit
  `8071078`; gate 10/10; live schema URL updated).
- **Only remaining drift:** the new **chem_1_4** sub-strand emits `LESSONS[].number` as a string
  (`"1"`) not an integer (all 8 lessons). Flagged to Mark. Corpus is also **growing past the original
  13** (Chemistry now appearing) — expect dozens→hundreds.
- **Drift snapshots committed:** `docs/drift.md` (latest = `c9a539f`, snapshot at `f36d47c`).

## SHIPPED 2026-06-17 (ARES data-contract)

- **Contract drafted, shared with ARES, and validated on every ingest.** ARES agreed to
  canonicalise output. `app/src/ingest/ares-contract.schema.json` is the single source of truth
  (co-located so the validator imports it AND it's the artifact shared with ARES). New
  `src/ingest/contract.ts` — a dependency-free subset validator (no ajv) emitting alias/typo-aware
  drift messages; was wired NON-BLOCKING into ingest pre-flight (later promoted to a hard gate, see
  2026-06-22). `scripts/contract-drift.ts` prints the full per-file report; `scripts/contract-check.ts`
  is the DB-less gate. See DECISIONS (2026-06-17) + `docs/ARES-DATA-REQUEST.md`.

## SHIPPED 2026-06-17 (§5 editor refinements code-complete + round-trip regression)

- **§5 editor refinements — all three code-complete** (no new stored fields / no migration). tsc 0 / eslint 0.
  1. **Live-unsaved preview:** `POST /:id/preview`: **EDIT-gated** (`isEditorFor` — Teachers→404; GET
     stays read-gated) and runs the posted data through the real save hook (`enforceBundleStructure`)
     so an Editor previews only what they could save (admin/structural change→422); 4 MB cap (413).
     `PreviewBundle` posts `reduceFieldsToValues(useAllFormFields())` via a hidden `<form target=_blank>`.
     GET/POST share one `renderPreviewResponse`. `endpoints/previewBundle.ts` + `components/PreviewBundle`.
  2. **Teacher format toggle:** `(frontend)/lessons/[id]` Standard/Compact `?format=` toggle
     (server-rendered searchParam); default stays Compact (2026-06-16 decision).
  3. **Array row labels:** all five nested arrays show "<noun> N — <field>" via ONE shared
     `components/RowLabel` (clientProps `{field,noun}`); single importMap.js entry. See DECISIONS.
- **Repeatable round-trip regression — DONE, 3/3 on the Rock.** `app/scripts/roundtrip-regression.ts`:
  one self-cleaning command that proves the *stored* path (seed-if-missing taxonomy → ingest
  `bio_1_4_data.js` → publish → `generateForBundle` → diff vs the approved DOCX, Resource column
  excluded). Fully in-process on the Rock. Tears down everything it creates in a `finally`. Committed
  `890632e`. Rock gotchas logged: (1) commit+push before the Rock `git pull` can see a script; (2)
  stage the approved DOCX + data file on the Rock (`ARES_DEMO_PATH`, e.g. `/srv/lesson3/out/ares-demo`).

## SHIPPED 2026-06-16 (§5 content preview)

- **§5 content preview — DONE, DEPLOYED + verified on the Rock.** Teacher view
  (`app/(frontend)/lessons/[id]`) renders all three documents (FE/ST omitted when absent). Admin
  draft-capable preview: `generator/previewBundle.ts` (HTML-only render core + shared `docxToSections`,
  no published gate), `endpoints/previewBundle.ts` (`GET /:id/preview?format=…`, access-gated via
  `findReadableBundle(draft:true)`, script-free CSP-locked HTML, 422 via `validateGeneratable` for
  incomplete drafts), a `PreviewBundle` button, `endpoints/parseFormat.ts` (shared `?format=` parser).
  - **On-screen preview defaults to COMPACT** (admin Preview keeps a toggle; teacher inline view is
    Compact-only). Reason: the Resource column is deferred/blank, so Standard's on-screen view shows
    an empty column. **Decided AGAINST injecting fixed column widths into the HTML preview** —
    faithful layout/colour belongs to the **PDF** (the converted DOCX). See DECISIONS 2026-06-16.
- **Corpus published + deduped → 13 canonical published bundles** (10 Biology + 3 Math); duplicates
  deleted. **6/13 produce empty FE/ST** (upstream gap — trust the generator's null buffers).
- **Codex review triaged.** Fixed: #5 (preview blanket-catch), #8 (`publish-drafts` exit code), #1
  (`PAYLOAD_SECRET` prod fail-fast), #10 (scaffold route removed). Deferred items rolled into the
  readiness backlog (see NEXT-SESSION).

## SHIPPED 2026-06-14 (web upload + .json ingest + branding + idle-logout)

- **Site-Admin web upload + `.json` ingest.** Ingest reads `.js` AND `.json` (`extractAresJson` =
  safe JSON.parse + `__proto__`/required-group guards). Site-Admin-only browser upload `POST
  /api/lesson-bundles/upload` (JSON-only, server-side `isSiteAdmin` gate) — a DEVIATION from SPEC §7's
  "no HTTP/upload surface", security-reviewed. Shared ingest core refactored to `ingestItems(payload, items)`.
- **Admin branding** "Lesson Plan Repository 3" (titleSuffix + custom Logo/Icon); **local Node pinned
  to 22.17.0** (`.nvmrc` + volta) to match the Rock.
- **Reliable idle-logout** (`IdleLogout` provider). Server-side 15-min expiry was already sound; added
  a wall-clock backstop so idle/backgrounded tabs terminate promptly. See DECISIONS (2026-06-14).
- **Phase 2+ "The App" decided:** a unified role-aware frontend all roles log into; cross-user
  features live here (browse/view/export, email-a-doc, messaging, translation, AI). See SPEC §2/§10.

## SHIPPED 2026-06-13 (§9 export first slice + compact format)

- **§9 export — first slice DONE and LIVE.** Per-export DOCX download as a `.zip` from the admin
  edit view, via a READ-access-gated endpoint `GET /api/lesson-bundles/:id/export?format=standard|compact`.
  Proven on the Rock: unauth → 401, bad format → 400, published → 200 + `application/zip` (3 docx).
- **Second LessonSequence format (`compact`).** Drops Section C's Resource column and re-balances
  widths. Lesson3-owned `app/src/generator/buildSowCompact.cjs` reusing vendored primitives; the
  vendored `standard` path stays byte-pristine (fidelity 3/3). New gate `app/scripts/format2-check.ts`.
- **Payload 3.85.0 → 3.85.1** (deliberate patch). **Dev caveat:** `payload generate:*` CLIs break on
  local Node 25 (bundled tsx 4.22.4); fine on the Rock's Node 22.

## Phases 0–4 (foundation, through 2026-06-09)

- **Phase 4 — DONE (bio_1_4 DB round-trip, 3/3 on the Rock).** Seeded Biology G10 + Mathematics G10
  → `ingest.ts` bio_1_4 → 1.0.0 draft → publish → generate → `compareDoc` vs approved = **3/3
  content-identical** (LessonSequence 381 blocks, FinalExplanation 52, SummaryTable 37; Resource
  column excluded). The architecture is validated end to end. See DECISIONS (2026-06-09 Phase-4 entry)
  for bugs fixed (the `payload run` silent no-op) + mechanics.
- **Phase 3 — safe ingest (SPEC §7).** Static extraction of ARES `.js` data modules → stored 1.0.0
  drafts via the Local API; dev-only CLI, never teacher-facing, **parsed, never executed**.
  - `app/src/ingest/extract.ts` — security-critical: `acorn` AST parse + `literalToJson` that
    evaluates ONLY pure data literals and **rejects** everything executable/dynamic via a
    `default`-throw (calls, identifier refs, member access, templates-with-`${}`, spread, getters,
    `__proto__` — at both object and `module.exports` layers). No `require`/`vm`/`eval`/`Function`.
    `acorn@8.16.0` is an exact direct dep.
  - `app/src/ingest/toBundle.ts` — inverse of the Phase-2 adapter (UPPERCASE groups → camelCase).
  - `app/src/ingest/validateGeneratable.ts` — completeness gate: META present; each lesson has `slo`
    + `summaryTablePrompt` + ≥1 framework phase; every `phase` ∈ vocab. Plus `deliverableWarnings()`
    (FE ≥1 section / ST ≥1 row) as WARN-ONLY (see the FE/ST decision, DECISIONS 2026-06-09).
  - `app/src/hooks/generatable.ts` — native publish-time gate (`ValidationError` when a publish isn't
    generatable; drafts may be incomplete WIP).
  - `app/src/ingest/index.ts` — read-only pre-flight (report every problem) then one all-or-nothing
    transaction; SubjectGrade resolved by exact `(Subject.name, grade)` match, require-existing, fail-loud.
  - GATE `app/scripts/ingest-extract-check.ts` (DB-less) — parity, non-execution canary, adversarial
    rejects, completeness assertions. DB-less gates honor `ARES_DEMO_PATH`.
  - **Decisions locked (DECISIONS 2026-06-09):** ingest = dev-only CLI / parse-never-execute;
    SubjectGrade exact-match/require-existing/fail-loud; ingested 1.0.0 is a DRAFT; FE/ST warn-only.
