# Decisions & Lessons

Durable, team-visible record of decisions made during the build and lessons learned
from corrections. Committed to git (unlike the assistant's private cross-session memory).

- **SPEC.md** remains canonical for *architecture and domain rules*. This file is for
  build-time decisions and corrections that don't rise to the level of spec changes.
- **Newest entries on top.** Each entry: date, one-line title, then the decision/lesson
  and the reasoning. When a correction teaches a general rule, capture the rule, not just
  the incident.

## 2026-06-07 — Scaffold layout, env var, and `output: 'standalone'`

- **Payload scaffolded into `./app`**, not the repo root, to preserve the committed root
  docs and co-tenancy `docker-compose.yml`. `docker-compose.yml` `build:` points at `./app`.
- **Standardized on `DATABASE_URI`.** `create-payload-app`'s blank template (v3.85.0) reads
  `process.env.DATABASE_URL`; changed `app/src/payload.config.ts` to `DATABASE_URI` to match
  the project convention and the committed `.env.example`.
- **Added `output: 'standalone'`** to `app/next.config.ts` — the generated Dockerfile copies
  `.next/standalone` and fails without it.
- **`create-payload-app` is fully scriptable** despite the abbreviated `--help`: the hidden
  flags `--db`, `--db-connection-string`, `--secret`, `--no-git`, `--no-agent` make it
  non-interactive. (The prior session's interactive/PTY blocker was avoidable.)

## 2026-06-07 — bio_1_4 fidelity proof passed

Regenerating the three DOCX from stored data reproduced the stakeholder-approved set
exactly, except the per-phase Resource column (which needs the absent Python recommender).
Validates the core architecture: edit the data, regenerate byte-stable documents.
See assistant memory `fidelity-proof-passed` for the diff detail.
